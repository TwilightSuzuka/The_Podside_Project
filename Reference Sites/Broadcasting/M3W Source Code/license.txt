Here is a short informal summary:

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software,
and to alter and to redistribute it,
provided that the following conditions are met:

1. All redistributions of files must retain all copyright
   notices that are currently in place, and this list of conditions without
   modification.

2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not

3. Modified versions must be plainly marked as

While this licence gives you the right to modify and redistribute the 
program as you please, I would like to inform you, that I consider
it appropriate if you read the styleguide before you do so and that
you can make me happy, if you inform me about use and changes you make
of the program so that the program can be improved for all users. I will
make any reasonable effort to merge changes into the main stream development 
of m3w.

While this software was developed in order to be usefull, it might not be.
It might actually format your harddisk, kill your cat, ruin your family live, and perform
other detrimental actions. While I am not aware of any such features of the program,
I warn you: You use the program on your own risk. Dont blame me! The only help
you will get from the author in these cases is the online help file.
Sady, many do not read the manual, in spite of the work I put into it.
